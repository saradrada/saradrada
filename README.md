### 👋 Hello, I'm Sara Ortiz Drada

I'm a detail-oriented iOS engineer who loves turning ideas into beautiful, intuitive apps that people genuinely enjoy using. I care deeply about accessibility, smooth animations, and creating interfaces that feel just right.

Clean code and reliable testing are part of my process, I believe great UX starts with great engineering. Lately, I’ve been excited about using AI to make mobile experiences smarter, more helpful and more personal.

Whether I'm prototyping at a hackathon ⚡ or fine-tuning a product for launch, I bring a mix of curiosity, craft, and good vibes to every project. 

Curious mind 💭
creative heart ❤️‍🔥
and always excited to build with kind, passionate humans 👩‍💻👨‍💻
